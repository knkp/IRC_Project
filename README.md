Inspired by how annoying the wall command can be if you and some friends are working on a linux box.

This project will essentialy acts like an IRC server-client on a local/remote machine. 

Just seemed like fun to make. 

Speaking of "make", just updated project with very simple make 
structure: simply type "make" in root directory and executables 
will be made in each associated directory
